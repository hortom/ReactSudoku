## ReactSudoku

The **purpose** of this repo is to learn React, [Mobx](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx) for state management and [FuxeBox](https://fuse-box.org) for bundler.

**Sudoku** is one of the most popular puzzle games of all time. The goal of Sudoku is to fill a 9×9 grid with numbers so that each row, column and 3×3 section contain all of the digits between 1 and 9.

### Todo
- [x] Adding Mobx~~
- [ ] Import, export functionality - WIP
- [ ] Handle Events (mouse, keyboard) - WIP
- [ ] Implement a solver wiht some simple heuristic and brute force if needed - WIP

### Further Goals
* Extend the solver, so it will be able to give human readable hints to solve Sudoku. For this it would be useful to add a layer over the grid to display additional information.

## To Start
```
npm install
node fuse.js
```
