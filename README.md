## ReactSudoku

The **purpose** of this repo is to learn React and Redux and some other stuffs.
For this I am using [Haxe](https://haxe.org) and I will create a Sudoku solver.

**Haxe** is an open source toolkit based on a modern, high level, strictly typed programming language, a cross-compiler, a complete cross-platform standard library and ways to access each platform's native capabilities.

**Sudoku** is one of the most popular puzzle games of all time. The goal of Sudoku is to fill a 9×9 grid with numbers so that each row, column and 3×3 section contain all of the digits between 1 and 9.

### Todo
* Integrate Redux
* Handle Events (mouse, keyboard)
* Import, export functionality
* Implement a solver with some tricks and brute force if needed
